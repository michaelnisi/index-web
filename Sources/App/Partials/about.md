# About

Originally a graphic designer, I’ve been building software for over twenty years. After experimenting with different stacks early on, the release of the first iPhone changed everything for me — I never looked back. Writing Swift every day still doesn’t get old. 

Applying type-driven design, I build robust systems that are flexible where they should be and constrained where it matters. 

I’ve seen almost every kind of iOS codebase. With my experience and architectural skills, I help teams pull apps out of the muddy waters of legacy code.

This website is where I put things I feel like sharing — and occasionally embarrass myself.
