# Now

*Updated January 15th, 2026, from my study in Walsrode, Germany.*

The holidays were slower than planned. Some dental issues turned meals into a rather frugal affair — an odd silver lining being that I didn’t gain any weight over Christmas.

Up here in northern Germany the year began with a brief return of real winter: snow, ice, that special hush it brings. As usual, it lasted only a few days. Now the thaw has set in, the snow is dissolving into grey memory, and the temperature is back above zero.

I didn’t manage to motivate myself to drive north to Denmark for icy waves. Still, I miss the water. I miss the ritual. And I’m counting the days until I head back to Spain at the end of January.
