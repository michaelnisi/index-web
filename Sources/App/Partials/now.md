Updated November 15th, 2025, from my little attic overlooking the beach in San Vicente de la Barquera, Cantabria, Northern Spain.

## Surfing

The surf has been good these past couple of weeks since I’ve been back. The weather is still very mild — this summer doesn’t seem to want to end. My favorite board at the moment is my new 10’ Garmendia pin tail. I’m learning a lot as I adapt to its faster, more flowing style.

## Programming

At EDEKA we’re preparing for prime time — the holiday season. May the checkout always run smoothly!

On the personal side, I’m building this website in Swift. It feels refreshing to apply the language outside of the usual app-context. I’m following Swift Server developments closely and can imagine myself working more in that domain in the future.
