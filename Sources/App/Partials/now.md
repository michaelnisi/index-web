# Now

## Surfing
Winter is here. Shorter days, storms, and big swells make it harder to find those clean longboard sessions. I surf when I can — and when I can’t, I let the ocean do its thing and spend the extra time on everything else.

## Programming
The last releases of the year are out the door. I like this quieter stretch: maintenance, tidying up loose ends, regrouping, and sketching plans for the new year.

Tracing has fascinated me since my Erlang days. Mobile apps are distributed systems, but observability tooling rarely reflects that. This holiday season I’m diving deeper into OpenTelemetry and Datadog to improve day-to-day visibility. Maintaining mobile apps still involves far too much inference and not enough data.
