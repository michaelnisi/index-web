# What drives you nuts?

> Clutter, dirt, noise, wasting time, being bored, uncertainty, people standing too close, being looked at, having to do things, sitting still, not knowing when something will end, high noon, meetings, surprises, fascism.

â€“ Liane Finck, who drew the cover of the August 2025 issue of [The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/issues/2025/08/21/)
