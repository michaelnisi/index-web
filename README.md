Personal blog and website for a software engineer and longboard surfer 🌊. I write about life, tech, and whatever I’m curious about. The site is intentionally small, fast, and clean—built with server-side Swift and tidy templates 🧐

## Quick start

```sh
swift build --quiet
swift run
```

## Stack

- [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.codes/) HTTP server 
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templates
- Markdown-to-HTML rendering
- Static assets (CSS/JS/images)

## Structure

- `Sources/App/` — Swift server code
- `Resources/Templates/` — Mustache templates
- `Resources/Partials/` — Markdown content
- `Public/` — static assets

Strong types and single fins. Bring back the personal web 💫
